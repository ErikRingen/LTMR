## Reliability of Instruments

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
cronbach %>% select(-c(mean, sd, ase))
```

## Model definitions

```{r, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
# IPTW + regression adjustment for maximal example, other models are nested within this one

# brms formula
m_h2_double$formula

m_h2_double$family

# priors
m_h2_double$prior %>% as_data_frame() %>% select(-c(group, dpar, nlpar, lb, ub, source)) %>% dplyr::filter(prior != "")
```
